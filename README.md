# Collision-Defense

This is a Java 2d game.
Instructions: Hit the bombs so that they ricochet and collide with the Slimes. Don't let the Slimes get too close.

The game can be run by either running the Main class, Applet class, or the jar file.

The contents in the web server folder were auxiliary files needed to host the java game online.
